        ("lonely", "Loneliness hits hard sometimes. Reaching out to someone  even just a quick text  often helps. Going somewhere public like a coffee shop, just to be around people."),

        ("confident", "Confidence feels great. Trust that feeling , you've probably earned it through hard work or experience. Let it guide your next moves."),
        ("overwhelmed", "When everything feels like too much, I pick one small thing I can finish. Just completing something  anything  usually makes the rest feel more manageable."),
        ("peaceful", "Peace is precious. I try to notice what created this feeling  was it quiet, nature, company? Remembering that helps me find it again later."),
        ("frustrated", "Frustration usually means I need a different approach. Taking a quick break often helps  when I come back, I see solutions I missed before."),
        ("nostalgic", "Nostalgia is bittersweet. I let myself enjoy the memories, then look for ways to bring what I loved about those times into my present life."),
        ("surprised", "Surprises shake things up. Even unexpected ones often lead somewhere interesting. I try to stay curious about where this might go."),
        ("disappointed", "Disappointment stings. I acknowledge the feeling, then look for what's still possible. Sometimes Plan B turns out better than Plan A."),
        ("content", "Contentment is underrated. Soaking in these satisfied moments builds resilience for tougher times. Enjoy it while it lasts."),
        ("energetic", "That energetic buzz is perfect for getting things done. I'd use it on something challenging - that energy can power through obstacles."),
        ("playful", "Playfulness is good for the soul. It reminds me not to take everything so seriously. A little silliness can reset a whole day."),
        ("romantic", "Romantic feelings make everything feel more meaningful. Whether it's about a person or a passion, that intensity can inspire beautiful things."),
