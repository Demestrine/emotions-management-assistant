# Emotion Management Assistant
The Emotion Management Assistant (EMMA) is a Python-based system designed to help users identify, understand, and manage their emotions through guided reflection and motivational responses.

The program allows users to record their current emotion (such as happy, sad, stressed, or tired) and then provides a random suggestion or motivational message from a PostgreSQL database.

EMMAâ€™s goal is to encourage emotional self-awareness and provide instant support  helping users maintain balance, focus, and positivity in their daily lives.
